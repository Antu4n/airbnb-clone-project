## Feature Breakdown
This section outlines the key features of the Airbnb Clone Project and how each contributes to creating a full-stack, real-world application.


### **1. User Management**

Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles securely. Role-based access allows for differentiation between hosts (who list properties) and guests (who book stays), ensuring tailored experiences.


### **2. Property Management**

Hosts can create, update, and delete property listings. Each listing includes essential details such as title, description, location, price, and availability, making it easy for guests to find suitable accommodations.


### **3. Booking System**

Guests can book available properties by selecting dates and confirming reservations. This system handles date conflicts, calculates total costs, and stores booking records linked to users and properties.


### **4. Review System**

Guests can leave feedback on properties after their stay. These reviews help maintain quality control and build trust among users by showcasing honest user experiences and ratings.


### **5. Payment Integration**

Bookings are linked to payment records that track the transaction amount, status, and method. This ensures transparency and simulates a real-world checkout experience.



### **6. API Security**

The backend API is secured with authentication mechanisms like JWT, ensuring that user data and actions are protected from unauthorized access.


### **7. CI/CD Integration**

Automated pipelines using GitHub Actions ensure consistent testing, linting, and deployment. This speeds up the development cycle and reduces manual errors.



### **8. GitHub Team Workflow**

The project is managed using GitHub repositories, branches, pull requests, and issues. This simulates industry-standard collaborative software development processes.

## API Security

Securing backend APIs is critical for protecting sensitive user data, ensuring transaction integrity, and preventing unauthorized access to platform resources. The following key security measures will be implemented in this project:


### **1. Authentication (JWT)**

We will use **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** to verify user identities. Upon successful login, users receive a token that must be included in future requests.
**Why?** Prevents unauthorized access by ensuring only registered users can interact with protected routes (e.g., creating bookings or listings).


### **2. Authorization**

Role-based authorization will control access to specific actions. For instance, only property owners can update or delete their own listings, while guests can only book or review properties.
**Why?** Prevents misuse of the system and ensures users can only access data and functions they are permitted to.


### **3. Rate Limiting**

Limits the number of requests a client can make within a given time window using tools like **Django Ratelimit** or **DRF throttling**.
**Why?** Protects the API from brute-force attacks and ensures system stability by preventing abuse.


### **4. Input Validation & Sanitization**

All inputs will be validated to avoid SQL injection, XSS, or other malicious attacks.
**Why?** Prevents attackers from injecting harmful code into the system.


### **5. Secure Payments**

While payment gateways are typically handled by third-party APIs (e.g., Stripe), our implementation ensures only authorized and verified users can initiate payment processes.
**Why?** Protects financial data and ensures that payments are only made for valid bookings.


### **6. HTTPS and Secure Headers**

All API communications will occur over **HTTPS**, and we will configure security headers to prevent attacks like clickjacking and content sniffing.
**Why?** Ensures encrypted communication and reduces vulnerabilities from web-based attacks.

## CI/CD Pipeline

**Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Deployment (CD)** are essential practices in modern software development. They automate the process of testing, building, and deploying applications, ensuring faster and more reliable delivery of code.

### Why CI/CD Is Important

* **Consistency**: Every push or pull request is automatically tested and validated, ensuring code quality.
* **Speed**: Automated deployments reduce downtime and manual errors.
* **Collaboration**: Teams can work in parallel and integrate changes frequently with confidence.
* **Feedback Loop**: Developers get immediate feedback on the impact of their changes.

### Tools

* **GitHub Actions**: Automates workflows such as running tests, linting code, and deploying updates upon each commit or merge.
* **Docker**: Creates consistent environments for development, testing, and deployment.
* **Docker Compose** (optional): Manages multi-container environments such as Django + PostgreSQL + Redis setups.
* **Heroku / Render / Railway** (optional): Platforms for automated cloud deployment using connected GitHub repositories.
